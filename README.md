# Rust Chain

## Overview

Rust Chain is a simple blockchain implementation in Rust. It provides a basic understanding of how a blockchain works and serves as a starting point for learning blockchain development with Rust. Please note that this implementation is naive and does not persist data over restarts.

## Features

- **Blockchain Basics**: Implements a basic blockchain with blocks and transactions.
- **Cargo Catch Development**: Uses Cargo Catch for development, making it easier to build and test Rust projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Cargo Catch](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-cachec)

### Development

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/subaquatic-pierre/rust-chain.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd rust-chain

3. Use Cargo Catch to run the project:

cargo catch run

csharp

This will build and run the project, allowing you to develop and test easily.

### Usage

- The blockchain is implemented in the `src/blockchain.rs` file.
- Explore and modify the code to understand the basics of blockchain development.

## Limitations

- Data is not persisted over restarts.
- This is a simple and educational implementation, not suitable for production use.
